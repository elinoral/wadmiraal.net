This is just a quick post. I just got to get this out. It's frustrating to me to see these small, yet simply avoidable, errors and/or mistakes so often in module code, and even more in Drupal projects. True, I see this less and less in contributed modules (good thing). The Drupal community does a pretty good job of educating its members, especially its contributors.

The following are a few &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; that won't have a big impact on your code. It's no more about writing code that works; it's mainly about writing excellent code (if at all possible with PHP/Drupal). If we as developers implement these small, simple tips, we can make our code cleaner, more performant (at a very small scale, of course) and more encapsulated.

## 1. Constant With Module Path

## 2. Loading Assets

## 3. Too Much Code In The Module File

## 4. Unclear Page State Dependency ? Require_once at top of Module file ?

## 5. Remove Those Variables On Uninstall
