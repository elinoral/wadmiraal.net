In [part 1](/lore/2018/01/29/drupal-forms-and-tdd-part-1-file-validation/), I showed how you can start using <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> when writing Drupal code, and how to apply it to testing a custom file validation callback. In [part 2](/lore/2018/02/05/drupal-forms-and-tdd-part-2-form-building/), we tackled testing the form building, and in [part 3](/lore/2018/02/12/drupal-forms-and-tdd-part-3-form-validation/), the form validation. In this final part, I'll show how you can test the form submission.
