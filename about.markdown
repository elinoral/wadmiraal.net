I'm an ex-full-stack developer, turned Engineering Manager. I have had the privilege of working on several great and challenging products. I work at [Sonar](https://sonarsource.com/).

I studied interaction design, and as such am very picky when it comes to UX and beautiful UIs. But I've dipped my toes in many areas: I've been a system administrator for a few years (LPIC-1 certified, if certifications are your thing), I've done quite some DevOps (lots of Docker and CI/CD pipelines; I hate Jenkins with a passion), I've managed projects, and I now manage people.

I used to work a *lot* with Drupal, and am the author of several modules on [www.drupal.org](http://www.drupal.org). When I joined Sonar, I worked mostly on [SonarQube](https://sonarqube.org/), and today I help build features targetting larger enterprises. I *love* my job. I love helping teams and individuals grow and reaching their full potential, while delivering exciting products for our users.

Except helping build great teams and products, I thoroughly enjoy reading and spending time with my wife and our two lovely kids.
