<h1>About</h1>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col twelvecol last">
        <p>I'm a dutch guy, married to a beautiful french woman and living in Switzerland, in the old and gorgeous city of <a rel="nofollo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fribourg">Fribourg</a>, which also has the particularity of having two official languages (french and german), despite being a city of only ~30'000.</p>
        <p>Talk about a cultural mixup...</p>
        <p>Anyhow...</p>

        <p>I'm a &ldquo;full-stack&rdquo; web developer. As such, I have had the privilege of working on several great and challenging products. I do both front-end and the back-end development, although I consider myself more of a front-end specialist.</p>
        <p>I studied interaction design, and as such am very picky when it comes to UX and beatiful UIs.</p>
        <p>I work a <em>lot</em> with Drupal, and am the author of several modules on www.drupal.org.</p>

        <p>I <em>love</em> my job. Developing has become a passion and I enjoy (almost) every day I spend on the job.</p>
        <p>Except coding and crafting intuitive UIs, I thoroughly enjoy reading.</p>
        <p>Other than that, I like the classic, boring, I've-read-that-before-stuff, like movies, music, spending time with my family and friends, etc.</p>

        <p>Eventhough I'm mainly a front-end developer, I try out many different languages and try to keep up with the rapidly changing technology landscape. At the time of writing, I'm digging into <a rel="nofollo" href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.</p>
        <p>Other than Javascript code, HTML markup and CSS styles, a large portion of my time goes into PHP.</p>
