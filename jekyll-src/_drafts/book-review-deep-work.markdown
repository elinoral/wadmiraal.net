To say this book has changed my way of seeing my work and personal life is a slight understatement. I started reading&mdash;actually, _studying_ is a better term&mdash;during the last week of December 2017, and first week of January 2018. And it has drastically changed the way I do things, and organize my life. In fact, as you may have noticed, I started blogging again. I decided to try and aim for 1 post a week in the first half of 2018. And I'm pretty well on track so far, while having more responsibilities and obligations, both professionally and personally, than in 2017. 

I decided to read _[Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)_ after reading a blog post entitled [Deep Work: Gaining Focus and Nobility in Your Work](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/deep-work-gaining-focus-and-reaching-for-nobility-in-your-work). It struck a chord in me.
