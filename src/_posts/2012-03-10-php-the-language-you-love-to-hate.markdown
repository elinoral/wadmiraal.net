## I love PHP

I love PHP. Seriously.

I love the fact that it's easy, and yet so powerfull. It's flexible in so many ways. You can do some pretty crazy stuff and yet get away with it.

I love the way that variables are not strictly typed: re-using the same variables in different contexts (**heresy !!**) and use-cases can sometimes really make your code more readable and understandable. It's so much easier to reuse a `$temp` variable when you just need a temporary storage for some logic/math/other-use-case-here, be it a string, float or array.

I love all the great frameworks and products that exist in PHP.

I love the way that you can so easily deploy new code to your products (re-compile ? don't make me laugh ! restart your Tomcat server ? Are you nuts ?!).

I love that PHP was thought for the web. Making web applications is just a breeze.

I love that PHP gives you the choice between OO and procedural style programming (although PHP is not an OOP language, whatever the syntax...).

I love PHP arrays' `[]` push syntax (I just miss it when writing Javascript...).

I love PHP's associative arrays.

I love it that PHP has an incredibly rich API for doing just about anything (from SOAP to dog-training: it's all there).

I love it that the PHP documentation is so incredibly rich.

I love it that PHP is cheap to develop for. Got an idea (a new Instapapper, tadalist, etc), just for fun ? Don't want to spend hundreds of dollars making it ? Get a cheap 20$/year hosting package, spend a few nights and weekends and bingo ! You're live ! Try that with other languages that require expensive, dedicated hosting...

I *love* PHP...


## I hate PHP

I hate PHP. Seriously.

I hate the fact that it's so incredibly bloated with unnecessary functionality.

I hate the fact that for some functions / language constructs, there are like 20 aliases available.

I hate the fact that the string API is so inconsistent.

I hate the fact that the array API is so inconsistent.

I hate the fact that the (insert specification here) API is so inconsistent.

I hate the fact that there are so many irrelevant products and frameworks out there\*.

I hate the fact that you have 10 ways to do the exact same thing (ever used `split` vs `explode` ?), however not all methods having the same impact on performance.

I hate the fact that on the documentation pages, 50% of the comments are just dumb and irrelevant.

I hate the obscure error messages (*T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM* what ?!?).

I ***hate*** the fact that PHP tries to be always backward-compatible. I mean: what the heck ??

I *hate* PHP...


\* hey, by the way: [check out my own framework here](https://github.com/wadmiraal/Colibri)... OMG ! I'm a PHP developper with his own framework ! What will my mum say ?
