Drupal 8 is under way, and it's going to be awesome. There are many, many new features in core that will make this a CMS to reckon with. The Drupal team has made many design decisions that will ensure the relevance of the system for years to come.

We mainly talk about Drupal's new features when talking about Drupal 8, and why it is going to be so awesome. But I would like to focus on another point.

## Getting of the Island

Drupal has a history of re-inventing the wheel. Except for jQuery, up until Drupal 7, everything in core was custom built. There was a reason for this: for years, it was hard to find quality, well-maintained libraries in the PHP world. Sure, there were some. But, as you will probably remember (or, maybe not), much of third-party PHP libraries on the internet were clumsy and amateurish in its design (not that Drupal didn't have design issues of its own).

So, pretty early on, the Drupal team decided to keep things in-house, so as to have control.

Fast-forward to 2013, the year the PHP FIG group published PSR-0, a formal standards guide to increase PHP quality. This standard got quickly adopted by members of the PHP community that were yearning for a higher quality standard in PHP code. The same year, Composer got wide-spread attention. This encouraged PHP developers to start focusing on making there code easily installable via Composer, which encouraged them to adhere to the PHP FIG standard. When Github made source-code hosting hip again, with those nifty badges in README files, library maintainers started to realize how &ldquo;cool&rdquo; continuously tested code looked, and more and more libraries have some sort of code coverage, some projects aiming to get a 100% test coverage.

Today, we can say the PHP landscape changed drastically. Sure, the language is still pretty bad. But it's a fact we have to live with. The projects built on PHP, however, have greatly increased in quality and &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo;. Monolithic frameworks are starting to fade in favor of small, well maintained and re-usable components. Libraries now tend to focus on one thing and do that thing *really well*.

The Drupal team acknowledged this fact. And decided it was time for Drupal to move &ldquo;off the Island&rdquo; Drupal 8 not only includes a few third-party libraries, it includes *a lot*. The Drupal
