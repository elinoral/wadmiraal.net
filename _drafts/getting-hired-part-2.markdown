For any given job posting, you might be competing with dozens of other developers, perhaps with more experience than you. So how can you stand a chance to still get the job?

The first thing I do when looking at a job application, is look for online work. A link to a GitHub account is a huge plus. Other things like CodePen can also be interesting. Of the too of my head, some interesting things you might do on CodePen include complex, pure-CSS interactions, WebGL animations, or even a simple game.

## Do Open Source work
Contribute to some project you like, or build something on your own. Doesn't have to be useful, can even be something fun.
Make sure your work is credited and linked to some online account (like GitHub
Make sure it's easy to test (build+hosted, or clear instructions for running locally)
Write a good README

## Write clean elegant code
Any public work should be well written. Comments, style guide, good naming
If applicable, write good, thorough documentation. Can all be in README, or wiki, or whatever.
Write tests, and strive for high coverage. Add a CI to the mix if applicable and possible, and use the public badge it provides. Use QA tool like SonarCloud or Codeclimate to improve your code, and show quality metrics on project page.

## Choose wisely
All things equal, prefer a company active in open source. Will allow you to contribute while getting paid for it, and those contributions will usually be public. This can be linked to for future job applications.
All things equal, prefer a company willing to explore new technologies and techniques. A job writing IEE Java, or Cobol, might pay higher, but the experience you get is also much narrower, and you might end up coding yourself in a corner

## Invest in knowledge
Always Keep learning. Read at least 1 technical book per year (preferably more). 
Put aside some time every week to code. Doesn't have to be long. But get something rolling. With time, you will invest less time, and that's ok. But use your early career years to build up as much experience as you can, on and off the job.
Read about other things! Learn about nature, art, history, whatever you fancy. The wider your horizon, the more likely you will be able to approach complex problems with a fresh perspective.
Raise your hand if the company is asking for volunteers to try out or learn a new technology (but make sure you know the implications, if any). Those are golden opportunities to learn new things while getting paid for it. 
Learn from great open source projects. Crack the code open, and read. See how others solve problems, not just technical, but also about code organisation, maintenability, documentation, etc. This is an invaluable and intarrissable source of inspiration and knowledge. Use it.
Diversify! New hot framework Vs good architecture practices

## Know they enemy
Job posting seems written by person who doesn't have a clue? Careful: either company with no prior in-house experience (i.e. outsourced before), or first filter is done by HR dept. In both cases, you may need to focus a bit more on cover letter, as they might not have any other means of judging your application. But do not ignore all the rest! After the initial filter, your profile might be judged by someone who does have the knowledge and expertise (usually a dev or a team manager).
What's is being asked? Too much buzz words? Fear you won't match? Know that these sometimes serve more to attract candidates rather than filter them out. If you know JS well, but have no experience in React, you can learn on the job. Of course, if they ask for Java and you only know JS or PHP, it won't work…
Know the company! What do they do? What projects/products? Blog? Employees speak at conferences? Podcast? Gather as much info as you can. Will prevent you from looking like an idiot, and show genuine interest.

## Be bold
Probably the hardest part
Apply for a job, and follow up about 1 week later. Don't be pushy, but show genuine enthusiasm and interest. For example… This will help you stand out (remember all those résumés?)
Call if the job as specifies a contact person.
If you're too junior, show you're all pumped up and willing to learn.
Sending a cover letter with only a résumé is the best way to never hear back. Not even a "No"
Ask for feedback if rejected. Show you're willing to grow.
Ask peers or people with more experience for feedback on résumé and online presence/work
Don't be afraid to have an opinion! But don't be stubborn.

## Know your worth
Don't accept unpaid internships (unless Google). With commute+lunch, might cost more than worth. Compare with a week at home doing an intensive Udemy course, and having some open source code to push to GH at the end. Probably better investment
Of course, if no CS degree nor experience, might be necessary. But Make sure you negotiate a strict duration after which a compensation is in order, or the internship is terminated
