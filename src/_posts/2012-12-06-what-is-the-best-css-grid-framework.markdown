How many CSS grid frameworks are there out there anyway ? 

Have you noticed how many 960gs clones, 1140, 1280, whatever resolution specific grids there are ? What gives ?

I've come to discover one that I patriculary like, and I'll share it, just with you. It'll be our special secret. 

But first, let me tell you what I think a CSS grid should *not* provide.

## What a CSS Grid should *not* provide

* It should never, ever have ***any*** impact on design. 
No font sizes, font families, line heights. 
No CSS resets, no fancy button styles, **nothing**.
That's the designer's job
