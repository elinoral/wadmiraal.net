        <p>I'm a dutch guy, married to a beautiful french woman and living in Switzerland, in the old and gorgeous city of <a rel="nofollo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fribourg">Fribourg</a>, which also has the particularity of having two official languages (french and german), despite being a city of only ~30'000.</p>
        <p>Talk about a cultural mixup...</p>
        <p>Anyhow...</p>

        <p>I'm a developer for <a href="http://www.connect-i.ch/">Connect-i</a>, a small but great web development company.</p>
        <p>I have the privilege of working on several great and challenging products and have, so far, had the luck of working on both front-end and the back-end code.</p>
        <p>Working for Connect-i, I do a lot with Drupal. We attend Drupalcons, sponsor it from time to time and I maintain several Drupal modules, on behalf of Connect-i.</p>

        <p>I <em>love</em> my job. Developing has become a passion and I enjoy (almost) every day I spend on the job.</p>
        <p>Except coding and crafting intuitive UIs, I thoroughly enjoy reading, which even grew into a little pet project called <a href="http://www.100-must-read-books.net/">100 Must Read Books</a>.</p>
        <p>Other than that, I like the classic, boring, I've-read-that-before-stuff, like movies, music, spending time with my family and friends, etc.</p>

        <p>I'm mainly a PHP developer, though I try out many different languages and try to keep up with the rapidly changing landscape. At the time of writing, I'm digging into <a rel="nofollo" href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.</p>
        <p>Other than PHP, a large portion of my time goes into Javascript code, HTML markup and CSS (well, SCSS actually) styles.</p>
