It often baffles me that countries still stick to Imperial (or Customary) units in day to day life. Many government agencies of these countries have indeed suggested switching to the metric system, but until now there has been quite some push back from the masses and/or right-wing nationalists to *keep the darn stuff* (perhaps because the original metric system was introduced by the French).

Do these people even know *what* the metric system is, and how *incredibly elegant* it is ?

Let me rant about this for a minute.

## It Starts With Water

Lets just, for simplicity's sake, dumb it all down and start from the beginning. Historically, things didn't quite go this way, but you'll at least get the point.

For any measurement system, you need a starting point. It can either be completely arbitrary (like the original [Fahrenheit](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fahrenheit) system), or take some reproduceable physical *state* (like the [Celcius](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Celsius) system).

The Celcius system uses 2 very easily reproduceable physical states of the most abundant element on earth, water:

* 0 째C is the temperature at which water *freezes*
* 100 째C is the temperature at which water *boils*

Now, even though the exact measurement *would* depend on conditions like atmospheric pressure and water composition, it is *mostly* accurate and reproducible around the globe. So, a person in Japan could very easily build her own thermometer, travel to Greenland and test it there, and would get pretty accurate results.

That is a simple and elegant way to measure temperature. Moving on.

## Distance

The French introduced the [*metre*](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_the_metre), which is the reason this all is called the *Metric system*. It was not a completely arbitrary measurement (based on the Earth circumference), however pretty difficult to measure for any average Joe.

The *metre* is a great unit, because it is used in multiples. For instance, where some countries use *inches*, *feet* and *miles*, the metric system uses *centimetres* (100th of a meter), *metres* and *kilometres* (1'000 *metres*). These do not require any complex rules (like 1 *mile* = 5'280 *feet* = 63'360 *inches*&mdash;*ouch !*) but are based on multiples of 10 (1 *kilometre* = 1'000 *metres* = 100'000 *centimetres*). Once you know the meaning of the latin prefixes (which are also used for measuring *mass* and *bytes*&mdash;*kilobytes*, *megabytes*, etc), it is pretty easy to do the conversion.

Being multiples, we actually use many variants:

* *millimetre*, a 1'000th of a *metre*
* *centimetre*, a 100th of a *metre*
* *decimetre*, a 10th of a *metre*
* *decametre*, 10 *metres*
* *hectometre*, 100 *metres*
* *kilometre*, 1'000 *metres*
* *megametre*, 1'000'000 *metres*

*Millimetres* and smaller variants are commonly used in industries where precision is important. *Centimetres* and *metres* are used in day-to-day measurements. *Decimetres* are mostly used in volumes, like *cubic-decimetres* (written *dm^3*). *Decametres* are not commonly used, but *hectometres* are used for large surfaces, and a *square-hectometre* (*hm^2*) is known as a *hectare*. Finally, *kilometres* are commonly used for long distances.

We now have a way to measure distances. Lets get back to our water and build from there.

## Volume

As we saw with the temperature, water is a perfect element to base measurements on. It's abundant, and the basis of life on our planet.

This is where things start to get really cool. We have our distance unit (the *metre*). Lets apply it to volumes.

We define that 1 *cubic-decimetre* (*1 dm^3*) is called a *litre*. This is easier for day-to-day use, and is a quite useful base measure.

*1 litre* is *1 dm^3*. Which means that *1 m^3* is *1000 litres*.

Neat. We can now easily relate volumes to distances.

# Energy

We have a measurement of temperature and volume. *Energy* is another important thing we need to be able to measure, and it is closely related to temperature.

Now, if we raise *1 litre* of water by *1 째C*, we use a certain amount of energy. We can define *that* amount of energy as... a (large) *calorie* (also known as a *[kcal](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Calorie)*).

So, *1 kcal* is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of *1 litre* of water by *1 째C*.

Pretty neat. We now have a simple, almost 1-to-1 relationship between temperature, energy, volume and distance. Believe me, this is *so* much easier when solving math problems in school.

## Mass

Still keeping our water as a reference point, we can define *1 litre* of water as a certain unit of mass. We call it a *kilogram*. For simplicity, a *litre* of water is the same as 1'000 *grams*, which is why we usually refer to it as *1 kilogram*.

Just as for *metres*, *grams* can be used in multiples with the same prefixes, although we usually use only *kilograms*, *grams*, *milligrams* and *microgrames* (1'000'000th of a *gram*).

## Conclusion

You tell me. I'm done with my rant. Cheers.
