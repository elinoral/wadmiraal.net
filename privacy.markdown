This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit my blog (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;).

## Personal information collected

This Site stores a single cookie on your computer when you first visit the Site. This cookie stores your preference on whether or not you wish to opt out of analytics tracking. Analytics tracking basically allows me to know what blog posts are popular, and how people navigate the Site. Except this preference, _no other personal data is stored by the Site itself._

**However**, this Site uses third-party services for analytics and commenting, which _do_ store other personal data. These services are:

### Google Analytics (with anonymized IP)

_Note: **you can opt out of this when visiting the site for the first time.** If you are unsure of what you answered, or want to change your mind, you can [clear all your cookies](https://www.google.ch/search?q=how+to+clear+my+cookies) for this Site. The question will then pop-up again, allowing you to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics._

The Site uses [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/) to track visitors. The _anonymized IP_ setting is enabled, meaning Google doesn't store your full IP, and doesn't know your _exact_ location (although it can know what region of the globe you're from).

### Disqus

The Site uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) to allow commenting on posts. Disqus stores and tracks personal data when you interact with their service, and can track you between different sites. You can read more about [Disqus' GDPR compliancy here](https://blog.disqus.com/update-on-privacy-and-gdpr-compliance).

*Personal Data: Cookies and Usage Data*

The Site doesn't store any personal information, and the information stored by third-party services is not under my control, nor do I have detailed access to it. However, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me at wad [at] wadmiraal [dot] net.
